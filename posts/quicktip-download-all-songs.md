# Quick Tip: Easily download all Apple Music songs on iPhone
<time>Jul 21, 2019</time>

Here's a quick tip, for those _so invested_ in the Apple ecosystem that they have an iPhone, a Mac, and use Apple Music.

I wanted my music available offline, but I didn't want to download them one at a time. So iTunes's smart playlists came to the rescue!

Here's how I set it up:

### On the mac

First open up iTunes on your mac, and select `File > New > Smart Playlist`:

Then, make your rules look like the following. Note the `is not`, for Artists. The idea is to match every song.

Finally, rename the playlist. I picked "All Songs", but you can choose any similarly descriptive name:

### On the iPhone

Now, fire up the music app on your iPhone, and go to `Playlists > All Songs`. Then, just hit the download icon:

You may want to plug your phone in and connect to Wifi, since this will now be downloading all your songs. And even better, your phone should now automatically download any new songs as you add them to your library!
